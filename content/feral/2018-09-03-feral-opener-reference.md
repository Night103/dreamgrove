### General Feral Opener Sequence

## Note about openers
An opener is not a big part of your dps. To most this might be immediately obvious, but a lot of people tend to vastly overrate the importance of a good opener. With that caveat out of the way, here is the current reference opener which we intend to keep up-to-date through the expansion. If you have any ideas about how to improve this opener, feel free to contact me. This opener is a intended to be generally useful, but obviously there might be niche situations where something else is better.

**If you are a novice at feral, I'd strongly recommend starting with a guide aimed at novices as opener optimizations are completely useless effort before you are atleast an intermediate feral**

# Precombat
*During countdown:*

1. If you have bloodtalons: Precast {{<spell 8936 "Regrowth">}} to gain 2 stacks of {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}}.
2. Enter {{<spell 5215 "Prowl">}}
3. Cast {{<spell 106951 "Berserk">}} (but not {{<spell 102543 "Incarnation">}}) 1 seconds before combat start

# Start of combat
**The opener sequence divides into two from here, one sabertooth-centric one and a more normal one. Because of Sabertooths Rip refresh mechanic, it is of utmost importance to apply a rip with the highest possible strength as early as possible - this may include hardcasting Regrowth, which is otherwise a loss.**

**For any build containing Sabertooth:**

*As combat starts:*

1. Cast {{<spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury">}}, if you either have {{<spell 155580 "Lunar Inspiration">}}, **or** do NOT have {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}}.
2. Cast {{<spell 1822 "Rake">}}.
3. Cast {{<spell 274837 "Feral Frenzy">}}, if talented and skip to step 8.
4. Cast {{<spell 155625 "Moonfire">}}, if you have {{<spell 155580 "Lunar Inspiration">}}.
5. If do not have {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}} talented:
   * Apply {{<spell 106832 "Thrash">}}
   * Cast {{<spell 5221 "Shred">}}, until 5 combo points.
   * Skip to step 8.
6. If you have {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}} and {{<spell 155580 "Lunar Inspiration">}} talented:
   * Cast {{<spell 155625 "Moonfire">}} until 5 combo points, saving your last remaining BT stack
   * Skip to step 8.
7. If you have {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}} but not {{<spell 155580 "Lunar Inspiration">}} talented:
   * Cast {{<spell 106832 "Thrash">}}, consuming your last BT stack.
   * Cast {{<spell 5221 "Shred">}}, until 5 combo points.
   * Break form and hardcast {{<spell 8936 "Regrowth">}}
   * Re-enter form by casting {{<spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury">}}.
   * Skip to step 8.
8.  Cast Rip, if executed correctly it should be applied at 5 combo points with all your available damage mods.

**For any build without Sabertooth:**

*As combat starts:*

1. Cast {{<spell 5217 "Tiger's Fury">}}
2. Cast {{<spell 1822 "Rake">}}

   * Cast {{<spell 8936 "Regrowth">}}, if you have {{<spell 155672 "Bloodtalons">}}
   * Skip to 9
8. If you didn't get a {{<spell 16974 "Predatory Swiftness">}} proc from your SR cast, or don't have SR:
   * Cast {{<spell 155625 "Moonfire">}}, if you have {{<spell 155580 "Lunar Inspiration">}} until 5 combo points and skip to 9.
   * Cast {{<spell 106832 "Thrash">}}

*Continue with normal rotation from this point.*

# Notes about the opener
This opener can look quite complex, and it is - mostly because of how many talents we have that affect it. But once you understand the fundamentals of the feral rotation you will quickly realise that there is really nothing unique about this opener. Almost every step here (with the exception of the hardcast regrowth) is just the application of the normal rotation.

The most odd-looking part to most people is the fact that you end up spamming moonfire in a lot of situations, this is because Moonfire doesn't consume BT stacks, allowing you keep your original pre-casted BT stack until your application of Rip without consuming it in the process. This is uncommon in normal gameplay outside of the opener, but can arise if you for example have to use your PS charge earlier than 4 combo points.
